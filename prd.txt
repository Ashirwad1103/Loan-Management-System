## Requirements

1. Define a Loan Application class with attributes such as applicant's name, credit score, loan amount, loan purpose, income, employment status, and other relevant information.
2. Develop a Risk Assessment module to analyze loan applications based on factors like credit score, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, loan amount, and purpose. Assign a risk score to each application.
3. Implement a Loan Approval module that uses the risk score and predefined lending criteria to approve or reject a loan application.
4. Design a RESTful API using Python and FastAPI to expose the loan approval functionality, supporting operations like submitting a new loan application, retrieving the status of a submitted application, and optionally updating or deleting an existing application.
5. Implement a queue-based architecture to handle a high volume of incoming loan applications using message brokers like RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka.
6. Add a scalable data storage solution for persisting loan applications and their statuses such as mySQL or MongoDB.
7. Incorporate monitoring and logging mechanisms to track the performance and status of the system.
8. Write unit and integration tests to validate the functionality and performance of the system.
9. Provide clear documentation on the system design, architecture, and instructions on how to set up, run, and test the system.

## Deliverables

1. A Python project containing the Loan Application class, Risk Assessment module, Loan Approval module, RESTful API implementation, queue-based processing architecture, data storage solution, monitoring and logging mechanisms, and unit and integration tests.
2. A README file with instructions on how to set up, run, and test the system, along with documentation on the system design and architecture.
